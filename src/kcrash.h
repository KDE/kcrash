 * \namespace KCrash
 * \inmodule KCrash
 *
 * \brief This namespace contains functions to handle crashes.
 *
 * It allows you to set a crash handler function that will be called
 * when your application crashes and also provides a default crash
 * handler that implements the following functionality:
 * \list
 * \li Launches the KDE crash display application (DrKonqi) to let
 * the user report the bug and/or debug it.
 * \li Calls an emergency save function that you can set with
 * setEmergencySaveFunction() to attempt to save the application's data.
 * \li Autorestarts your application.
 * \endlist
 *
 * \note All the above features are optional and you need to enable them
 * explicitly. By default, the defaultCrashHandler() will not do anything.
 * However, if you are using KApplication, it will by default enable launching
 * DrKonqi on crashes, unless the --nocrashhandler argument was passed on
 * the command line or the environment variable KDE_DEBUG is set to any value.
 */

 * call this function from your implementation if you want to use the
